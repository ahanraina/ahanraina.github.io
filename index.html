        <p>I am a writer based in New Jersey who hopes to build a career discussing issues of philosophy, culture, politics, and policy.
        I was educated at the University of Chicago, with degrees in Philosophy and in Law, Letters, and Society, the latter with a focus
        field in Law and Economics. I have till now mostly written for <i>the Harper Review</i>, and done research on moral philosophy, constitutional
        law, the philosophy of language, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. I also currently serve as a Series Editor for the blog of the American Philosophical Association.</p>

                <b>Abstract: </b> The American judicial system adjudicates cases concerning the infringement of
                constitutional rights in a unique manner compared to much of the rest of the world. The United
                States resolves these cases by the categorical striking of either the rights claim or infringing state
                action in what has been termed rights absolutism, while many other countries focus on whether
                the state action creates public benefit which is proportional to the harm caused by the rights
                infringement, in what is referred to as rights proportionality. I argue that rights absolutism
                implicitly assumes a normative theory of law grounded in a Dworkinian understanding of rights,
                which itself is grounded in Kantian moral theory. I further argue that judges have substantial
                reasons to assume the validity of value pluralism, and thus that the Dworkin-Kant model has the
                fatal flaw of being unable to account for pluralism. I suggest that the only viable solution is the
                adoption of an aretaic theory of law: one grounded in virtue ethical theory. I conclude that if
                judges approach rights adjudication within an aretaic frame, they necessarily reproduce the
                jurisprudence of proportionality, and indeed produce a stronger version of it.
